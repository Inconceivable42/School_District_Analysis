## Overview
The math and reading scores for the 9th grade at Thomas High School have come under scrutiny. This has resulted in us having to take those scores out of our district analysis and re-run the numbers for the high schools district wide.


## Analysis
Data was acquired in the form of .csv files. Nineth grade scores for Thomas High School were replaced with "Nan." All analysis for the district was re-run.


## Results
 * The overall district average math score went down 0.1 while the average reading score remained the same. Percentage passing math and reading went down by 0.2 and 0.3 percent respectively. And the percent overall passing decreased 0.1 percentage points.
 * The Thomas High School summary scores increased slightly after removing the 9th grade.
 * Thomas High School's placement among the other schools did not change (still in 2nd).
 * Replacing the 9th grade scores:
	+ Did not affect the scores for other grades.
	+ Scores by school spending remained the same.
	+ Scores by school size remained the same.
	+ Scores by school type remained the same.

  
## Summary
Differences between district scores and after Thomas High School 9th graders were removed? The grades for Thomas High School 9th graders had "Nan" in place of numbers. Because the number of students didn't change, the school stayed in the same size bin and spending bin. Because the 9th graders did not have scores, the overall percentage of passing students should not have change much because the 9th graders should not have been included in the analysis.
